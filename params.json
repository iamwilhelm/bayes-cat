It's an exercise to write a 2D game using an Entity Component System in a pure functional language called Elm.\r\n\r\n### Versions\r\nI've recently upgraded to Elm 0.17, which meant breaking changes. Also, I've implemented a better Entity-Component-System than I had before. Here's a log of the different versions.\r\n\r\n[v0.0.2](v0.0.2)\r\n- New Entity Component System \r\n- Gravity component available for different planets\r\n- Newtonian movemnts\r\n",
